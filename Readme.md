## Client-Product-Review Management App

A full-stack web application developed during my second year of university for the Systems of Design and Implementation course.
The application manages a many-to-many relationship between Clients, Products, and Reviews, using a PostgreSQL database.

This project helped me gain a deeper understanding of full-stack development, database design, and cloud deployment.
